# Day 1

## Why is a README important? ##
A README is the front page of a project. It explains what the code does and why. This helps your software proliferate as developers can understand how to use it and where they might need to.

## User stories / domain models ##

## Errors (are good) ##
Challenge 3, 4
```ruby
2.6.5 :002 > docking_station = DockingStation.new

Traceback (most recent call last):
        5: from /Users/annie/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.6.5/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'
        4: from /Users/annie/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.6.5/bin/irb:23:in `load'
        3: from /Users/annie/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.6.5/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/irb-1.0.0/exe/i
rb:11:in `<top (required)>'
        2: from (irb):2
        1: from (irb):2:in 'rescue in irb_binding'
NameError (uninitialized constant DockingStation)
```

The NameError means that the object we are asking irb to create (a DockingStation class object) is undefined. It tells you which line the error occurred on, and that it looked in the folder where ruby was installed and didn't find a native method DockingStation.

To solve the error, we created a class called DockingStation.
```ruby
class DockingStation
end

docking_station = DockingStation.new
```
